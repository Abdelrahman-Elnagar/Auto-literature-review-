It aims to explain both the algorithm selection process and the performance of the recommended algorithm on specific datasets. It uses causal reasoning and counterfactual interpretation for explainability.",Extracted from datasets using statistical algorithms,"Traditional meta-learning lacks explainability, transparency, and fairness. Existing interpretable tools often assume independent and identically distributed data features, ignoring causal relationships.","FIND, an explainable meta-learning framework, addresses the limitations of traditional meta-learning by offering transparency in algorithm selection.  Utilizing a neural network trained on simple, statistical, and information-theoretic meta-features, FIND selects algorithms based on predicted probabilities and leverages integrated gradients and causal reasoning to explain both the selection process and the chosen algorithm's performance on a given dataset.  This approach improves upon existing methods by incorporating causality and latent factors for a more comprehensive and interpretable meta-learning experience.","Xinyue Shao, Hongzhi Wang, Xiao Zhu, et al., ""FIND: Explainable Framework for Meta-learning,"" in Meta-Learning Research, 2018."
